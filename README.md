# VanillaGameEngine (idle + walk)

A tiny, **vanilla JS** browser playground for sprite uploads with **separate Idle and Walk animations**. Drop in two sprite sheets (same frame size), set frame size and FPS, then move with **arrow keys/WASD**. The engine auto-switches between Idle when still and Walk when moving.

## Features

- Zero dependencies, ES modules only
- Idle/Walk sprite inputs (or use the samples)
- HiDPI-safe canvas rendering
- Drag-and-drop (loads Walk by default)
- Adjustable frame size, FPS, scale, and movement speed
- MIT license

## Quick Start

1. Download this folder or the ZIP and open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click **Use Sample Idle** and **Use Sample Walk**, or upload your own sheets.
3. Enter **Frame W/H** (both sheets should share this), set **FPS/Scale/Speed**, then **Apply Settings**.
4. **Arrow keys** or **WASD** to move. Press **P** to pause.

> Tip: Use a single row or grid sprite sheet. Frames must be equal size across both Idle and Walk.
